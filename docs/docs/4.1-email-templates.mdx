When downloading provisioning files, Workflower will provide an email body for product subscription emails based on the current partner.

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/05-prodsub-tooltip.png'))} />

Simple copy and paste the tooltip into a new message to `production.subscription@coxautoinc.com` and attach the file you downloaded.

Support for this feature is available on (at least) the following partners:

- Darwin Automotive
- Bank of America
- CarNow
