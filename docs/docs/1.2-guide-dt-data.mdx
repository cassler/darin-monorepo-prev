import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';



<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/screenshot-dt-file.png'))} />

Here you can provide a file generated by Dealertrack. First, you'll need that file.

### Get Reporting from Dealertrack

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/download-dt-report3.png'))} />

1. Visit Dealertrack.com
2. Select the "Reports" tab > "Business Reports"
3. Enter the appropriate partner code and hit submit.

This will start a download of a CSV file used in the next step.

### Adding Report to Workflower

Select the file you just downloaded. Workflower will check to make sure it looks right. If not you'll see a message like this:

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/demo-b-05.png'))} />

If you provide the correct file, the message will be quite a bit more pleasant.

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/dt-success.png'))} />

You can now proceed to the next step.
