import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';



<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/03-dt-report.png'))} />

Here you can provide a file generated by Dealertrack. First, you'll need that file.

### Get Reporting from Dealertrack

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/download-dt-report3.png'))} />

1. Visit Dealertrack.com
2. Select the "Reports" tab > "Business Reports"
3. Enter the appropriate partner code and hit submit.

This will start a download of a CSV file used in the next step.

### Adding Report to Workflower

Select the file you just downloaded. Workflower will check to make sure it looks right. If not you'll see a message like this:

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/04-dt-problem.png'))} />

Workflower will also do some very basic checks to make sure you uploaded a report for the correct partner. Simply, it checks partner IDs to make sure they are formatted accordingly (ex: BOA expects 10 digit partner IDs).

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/06-dt-wrong.png'))} />

If you provide the correct file, the message will be quite a bit more pleasant.

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/05-dt-success.png'))} />

You can now proceed to the next step.
