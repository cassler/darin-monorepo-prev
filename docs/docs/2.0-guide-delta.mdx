Workflower Delta helps facilitate comparing similar documents such as DT business reports or dealermatch files. This becomes particularly useful when having to determine changes that have occured over time. Mixing and matching different report types is not currently supported,  **Each file must have the same columns for this tool to work as intended**

Click "Switch Mode" in the toolbar to use WF Delta

This tool uses a "Previous" and "Current" paradigm to determine what has been added and what has been removed. If an entry appears on the "previous" data but not the "current data" it will be labelled in red. Likewise, anything that appears only in the "current data" will be labelled in green.
