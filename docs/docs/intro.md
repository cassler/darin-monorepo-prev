### First Launch
When we first launch Workflower, we're presented with an empty state that's ready for our input.

### Loading Data Files
Now that we've selected a partner, we need to provide Workflower with two specific files.

1. **Reference Data** is a Dealertrack Business report for this partner.
2. **Request Data** is a CSV representing orders for this dealer that meets certain criteria.

<!-- ![Not Ready, need both files](/img/demo-06.png) -->
![Detail: both files succesfully loaded](/img/detail-02.png)

If everything looks right, the "Generate" button should now be enabled. Click it!
