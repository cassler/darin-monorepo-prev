### How to access table previews

You can preview a spreadsheet view of most files added to Workflower. Look for a button like this to summon a preview:

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/01-preview-btn.png'))} />

### Preview Modal Overview

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/02-preview-table.png'))} />

This view provides many of the tools you may expect from a normal spreadsheet. Additionally, Workflower allows you to select which columns to include in your preview. By default, Workflower will hide any columns that are blank on the first row - you can toggle these by clicking "Select Columns" and choosing which you would like to include or exclude.

<img alt='' src={(useBaseUrl('img/03-column-select.png'))} />

### Dismissing

You can return to your workflow by clicking outside the preview modal or "OK" on the bottom right.
