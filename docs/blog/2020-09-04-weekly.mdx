In the summer of 2019, I was asked to help with a challenge the team had parsing large dumps of messy client data on a regular basis. What was initially an ad hoc side project to help fill my afternoons would - over more than a year - grow in ambition and scale to eventually become Workflower. Earlier this week, Workflower 1.0 was released and suddenly that long path had, in a way, come to an end. Or has it?

You see, an early September release was planned months back. Heavy emphasis was placed on usability, stability and documentation; along with an artificially limited schedule. As such the release of Workflower actually brings with it *a drastically reduced feature list* from earlier prototypes. The release certainly includes the most valuable aspects of the suite - everything is rock solid and without frills. This is precisely how a 1.0 release should be.

Features that didn't make the cut for 1.0 are currently being used to fill out a roadmap for future releases. With that I'm happy to announce that Workflower 1.1 will be avilable shortly.

### Coming Soon in 1.1

- Initial release of "Delta Tool" for comparison of various CSV files. (Preview avilable in 1.0)
- CSV Previewer! You can inspect most files added to your workflow in a spreadsheet-like modal experience.
- Expanded documentation for both features. ([Preview here](/Darin-Cassler/workflower-monorepo/docs/delta))
